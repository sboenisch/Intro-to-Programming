My HTML notes

<p>In HTML you have elements which help to markup text. Also reorganize text
or display it different with elements.<br></p>
<p>Markup is a tool of HTLM to change the visual representation of text or
organize it.<br></p>
<p>For example: em is an element to let text show in cursive.<br></p>

<em>I want to be cursive.</em>
